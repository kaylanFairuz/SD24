## Question 1
[SPOJ - SDITSBST](https://www.spoj.com/problems/SDITSBST/)

In this problem you are given two type of query
1. Insert an integer to the list.
2. Given an integer x, you're about to find an integer k which represent x's index if the list is sorted in descending order. Note that in this problem we will use 1-based indexing.

As the problem title suggest, this problem intended to be solved using Binary Search Tree.

#### Input
The first line contains an integer Q, which denotes how many queries that follows.

The next Q lines will be one of the type queries which follow this format:

`1 x` means insert x to the list.

`2 x` means find x's index if the list is sorted in descending order.

#### Output
For each query type 2, print a line containing an integer as the answer or print "Data tidak ada" no quotes if the requested number does not exist in the current list.

#### Sample Input
```
10
1 100
1 74
2 100
2 70
1 152
1 21
1 33
2 100
2 21
2 1
```

#### Sample Output
```
1
Data tidak ada
2
5
Data tidak ada
```

#### Explanation
Until the third query, the current list is {100, 74}. Therefore you must print 1 as 100 is on the first index.

Arriving at the fourth query we haven't add any other number so the list still consists of {100, 74}. Since 70 is not in the list you must print "Data tidak ada" remember no quotes.

For the last three queries the list looks like this {152, 100, 74, 33, 21}
So the answer for the eighth, ninth, and tenth query respectively are 2, 5, and "Data tidak ada".

#### Constraints
1 ≤ Q ≤ 200000

1 ≤ x ≤ 1018

It is guaranteed that all integer that inserted in the list will be distinct.

#### Notes
Since the intended solution is using BST data structure. The testcases have been designed to be balanced i.e. you will never encounter such cases where the tree is skewed.
