## Questions <a name="qs"></a>
### Q20. Bottle Caps <a name="q20"></a>
Write a program to simulate the collection of bottle caps to spell apple. In every 100 caps, A and E occur 40 times each, and P and L occur 10 times each. Do 50 simulations and print the average number of caps per simulation.

### Q21. Lottery <a name="q21"></a>
The Lotto requires people to pick seven numbers from the numbers 1 to 40. Write a program to randomly generate and print five sets of seven numbers each (one set per line). No number is to be repeated in any of the sets; that is, exactly 35 of the 40 numbers must be used. If a number ( p, say) is generated that has been used already, the first unused number after p is used. (Assume that 1 follows 40.) For example, if 15 is generated but has been used already, 16 is tried, but if this has been used, 17 is tried, and so on, until an unused number is found.

### Q22. Eight Queens Problem <a name="q22"></a>
A function f(x) is defined for 0 £ x £ 1, and such that 0 £ f(x) < 1 for all 0 £ x < 1. Write a program to estimate the integral of f(x) from 0 to 1. Hint: estimate the area under the curve by generating points (x, y), 0 £ x < 1, 0 £ y < 1.
