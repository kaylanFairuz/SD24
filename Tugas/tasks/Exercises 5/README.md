## Questions <a name="qs"></a>
### Q13. Priority Queue <a name="q13"></a>
A priority queue is one in which items are added to the queue based on a priority number. Jobs with higher-priority numbers are closer to the head of the queue than those with lowerpriority numbers. A job is added to the queue in front of all jobs of lower priority but after all jobs of greater or equal priority.

Write declarations and functions to implement a priority queue. Each item in the queue has a job number (integer) and a priority number. Implement, at least, the following functions: (i) initialize an empty queue, (ii) add a job in its appropriate place in the queue, (iii) delete and dispose of the job at the head of the queue, and (iv) given a job number, remove that job from the queue.

### Q18. Sorting with Stacks <a name="q18"></a>
A stack, S1, contains some numbers in arbitrary order. Using another stack, S2, for temporary storage, show how to sort the numbers in S1 such that the smallest is at the top of S1 and the largest is at the bottom.
